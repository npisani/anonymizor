The purpose of this script is to parse functional requirements from a Microsoft Word document, generate test scenarios for each requirement using OpenAI's ChatGPT, and then save the generated test scenarios into a CSV file.

Here's a high-level overview of the script:

It reads functional requirements from a Word document (.docx file) and stores them in a list.
For each requirement, it generates test scenarios by calling ChatGPT with a specific prompt. The generated test scenarios are formatted as semicolon-separated fields, including Action, Data, and Result.
It processes the generated test scenarios by splitting them into individual fields and storing them in a dictionary.
The script writes the formatted test scenarios to a CSV file, including the Issue Id, Issue key, Test type, Test Summary, Test Priority, Component, Action, Data, and Result columns.
The resulting CSV file can then be used to import the test scenarios into a test management tool or for further analysis and validation.

Pythons Modules used:
configparser: This is a built-in module in Python, so no installation is necessary.
csv: This is a built-in module in Python, so no installation is necessary.
openai: This is not a built-in module, so it needs to be installed separately. You can install it using pip by running pip install openai.
docx: This is not a built-in module, so it needs to be installed separately. You can install it using pip by running pip install python-docx.
re: This is a built-in module in Python, so no installation is necessary.

How to use:
1. Run words.py against the Spec to pull out a list of all words used in the document.

2. Open unique_terms.txt and narrow the list down to the words or terms that need to be anonymized.

3. Update these parameters in anonymize.py:

These are the terms you want to anonymize:
sensitive_terms = ['SensitiveTerm01', 'SensitiveTerm02']

This is the name of the spec (must be in same directory as anonymize.py)
input_file = 'Functional Requirement Specification.docx'

This is the name of the anonymized document that will be created:
output_file = 'Functional Requirement Specification_anonymized.docx'

This is list of terms that were anonymized and what they were anonymized to. This is so you can reverse the anonymization in the test cases:
mapping_file = 'anonymized_terms_mapping.txt'

4. Run anonymize.py against the Spec document.

5. Run createtest.py against the anonymized spec document. Update this section of the script with your file names:
# Main script to parse requirements, generate test cases, and save to a CSV file
input_file = 'Functional Requirement Specification_anonymized.docx'
csv_output_file = 'test_cases.csv'

Prompt used for ChatGPT is: Generate test scenarios with positive, negative, and boundary tests to provide 100% software testing coverage for the following software requirement:\n\n{requirement}\n\nInclude specific data to use for testing and the expected results whenever possible.\n\nTest Scenarios:"
